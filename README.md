# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews using SVM

This project implements a basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The model classifies reviews as either positive or negative and achieves an accuracy of over 90% on a dataset of 10,000 reviews.

## Dataset

- Source: Amazon product reviews (10,000 entries)
- Each review is labeled as either positive or negative

## Model

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Library used: scikit-learn
- Accuracy: Approximately 90%
- Data split: 80% training, 20% testing
